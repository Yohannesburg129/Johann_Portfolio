# [Project 1: Natural Language Processing - Airline Customer Reviews](https://github.com/Yohannesburg129/capstone_project)

This is a project I did for my Data Science Bootcamp's capstone project where I used Natural Language Processing to help predict whether a customer's review of an airline led to a Yes/No recommendation. 

* Data for airline customer reviews was found on Kaggle
* Performed Data Cleaning to ensure no missing values
* Performed Data Analysis on Middle Eastern carriers to compare each airline and their overall performance.
* Used CountVectorizer to tokenize each word of each customer reviews
* Applied Machine Learning Models - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees - to compare which method produced the greatest test accuracy.


Below are just a few visuals of the data I analyzed using Python and Tableau. If you'd like a more in-depth look to the process I took, do please click the link and take a look through my code.
