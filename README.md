# [Project 1: Natural Language Processing - Airline Customer Reviews](https://github.com/Yohannesburg129/capstone_project)

This is a project I did for my Data Science Bootcamp's capstone project where I used Natural Language Processing to help predict whether a customer's review of an airline led to a Yes/No recommendation. 

* Data for airline customer reviews was found on Kaggle
* Performed Data Cleaning to ensure no missing values
* Performed Data Analysis on select business questions that are detailed in the attached Business Report
* Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees
